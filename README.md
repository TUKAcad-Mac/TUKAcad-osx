## What is TUKAcad?  

**TUKAcad** is a next-generation **computer-aided design (CAD) solution** tailored for the apparel and textile industries. Created by Tukatech, it empowers pattern makers, designers, and manufacturers to produce digital patterns and markers with professional-grade precision.  

By replacing manual drafting with a modern digital interface, TUKAcad streamlines the creation, grading, and layout of garment patterns. The system features intelligent automation tools for **grading across sizes**, **fabric consumption optimization**, and **marker creation**, ensuring efficient use of time and materials.  

With its robust set of measurement and design functions, TUKAcad eliminates repetitive manual steps while maintaining exact fit and design integrity. Its **3D visualization support** enables instant garment previews, helping users detect fit or proportion issues early in the process.  

The software’s intuitive layout and customizable workflow make it suitable for both small studios and large-scale production environments. Optimized for macOS, it delivers consistent performance and accuracy while handling complex garment data and multi-size grading.
